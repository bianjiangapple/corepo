this is a local problem, found by bianjiangapple.

assuming now there are 2 contributors to bianjiangapple/corepo (1 is from webui, another is a remote contributor with git commandline capability)

let's see what the collaboration look like :)

Solution 1:
I think it's an arithmetic progression staring with 2 and at step 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10!

Solution 2:
Remote contributor tries to solve the problem:
it's 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, yeah, fibonacci number!
maybe it's 4, 5, 9, 14, 23? also a fibonacci number!


End of the demo.
